GUI 
Engaging with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) becomes an enriching experience when leveraging Python, particularly through the utilization of the Turtle module. This module facilitates GUI development, offering a versatile toolkit for creating various projects and exercises. Notable examples include Spirograph, diverse polygonal shapes, and random walk simulations, all meticulously crafted using Python's Turtle module.
